In R, the **`drop_na()`** function from the **`tidyr`** package can be used to remove rows with missing values.

Here, **`y`** should be the column number or name in your data frame **`df`** that you want to consider for missing values.

Here's an example of how to use **`drop_na()`** to drop rows with missing values based on a particular column:

```{r}
library(tidyr)

# create a data frame with missing values
df <- data.frame(
  x = c(1, 2, NA, 4),
  y = c(NA, 5, 6, 7)
)

# drop rows with missing values in column "y"
df2 <- drop_na(df, y)

# view the result
df2


```

In this example, **`drop_na()`** is used to remove rows with missing values in the "y" column of the data frame **`df`**. The resulting data frame **`df2`** only contains the rows where "y" is not missing.

**Filter out values containing integers**

To filter out values that contain integers in R, you can use the **`grepl()`** function with a regular expression pattern that matches integers.

Here's an example:

```{r}
# Create a sample vector
vec <- c("apple", "banana", "123", "grape", "orange")

# Filter out values containing integers
filtered_vec <- vec[!grepl("\\d+", vec)]

# View the filtered vector
filtered_vec

```

In this example, the **`grepl()`** function is used with the regular expression pattern **`"\\d+"`**, which matches one or more digits. The **`!`** operator is used to negate the result, so that values that match the pattern are filtered out. The resulting logical vector is used to subset the original vector using the **`[`** operator.

Note that the regular expression pattern **`"\\d+"`** matches any sequence of one or more digits. If you only want to match integers (i.e., positive and negative whole numbers), you can use the pattern **`"^-?\\d+$"`**, which matches strings that start with an optional **`-`** sign, followed by one or more digits, and end with the end of the string.
